# Predict GPA of Graduating MSU Students


All the relevant packages required to run the code are mentioned at the top of the notebook. The relevant .csv files are present in the Git repository. Code can be run as normal through <b>main.ipynb</b>.


Grade Point Average (GPA) is a single cumulative number that represents one's entire academic performance. Through this project, I wanted to evaluate how GPA trends vary over the years and if they can used for future predictions. I mainly answered the following questions:
1. How accurate is past GPA data in predicting the present records
2. How do GPA trends vary across semesters and years


<b>Libraries Used:</b> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
